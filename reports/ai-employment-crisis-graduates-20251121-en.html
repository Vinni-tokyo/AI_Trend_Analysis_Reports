                <h3 class="subsection-title">1. Graduate Unemployment Surges: Worst Job Market in a Decade</h3>
                <p><strong>Current State:</strong> 2025 college graduates face the most constrained entry-level labor market in five years. In the US, unemployment for 22-27 year-old graduates reached 4.8%, exceeding the overall labor market rate of 4.0%, while unemployment for bachelor's degree holders aged 20-24 hit 6.6%, the highest in a decade excluding 2020. In South Korea, youth unemployment rose to 7.3% in April 2025, up 0.5 percentage points year-over-year, with 20-something college graduates experiencing 6.7% unemployment compared to 5.5% for high school graduates in the same age group.</p>

                    <div class="trend-card">
                        <h4>Regional Youth Unemployment Rates (2025)</h4>
                        <p>• <strong>United States:</strong> Young workers 10.8% (vs. 4.3% overall)<br>
                        • <strong>South Korea:</strong> Youth unemployment 7.3% (up 0.5%p YoY)<br>
                        • <strong>Japan:</strong> Youth unemployment 3.8% (relatively low)<br>
                        • <strong>China:</strong> Youth unemployment 16.5%<br>
                        • <strong>India:</strong> Youth unemployment 17%</p>

                        <p>• <strong>Class of 2025:</strong> 33% unemployed and job-seeking (vs. 20% in 2024)<br>
                        • <strong>Major Mismatch:</strong> 26% employed in fields unrelated to their degree<br>
                        • <strong>Success Rate:</strong> Only 30% of 2025 grads secured full-time jobs in their field<br>
                        • <strong>UK Example:</strong> 1.2 million graduates competing for 17,000 entry-level positions</p>

                </div>

                <p><strong>Outlook:</strong> Between 2025-2030, 14% of global workers are predicted to be forced into career transitions due to AI. Particularly in technology and finance sectors, generative AI is replacing human analytical capabilities, collapsing the traditional career ladder for college graduates.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">2. AI Automation Eliminates Entry-Level Jobs: 50% Replacement Forecast Within 5 Years</h3>
                <p><strong>Current State:</strong> Generative AI is rapidly replacing entry-level white-collar jobs. Anthropic's CEO warned that 50% of all entry-level white-collar jobs could be eliminated by AI within five years, and in 2025 alone, 77,999 jobs were lost to AI. Big Tech companies reduced new graduate hiring by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023, and 41% of global employers plan to reduce their workforce due to AI automation within the next five years. Since early 2025, employment for 22-25 year-old entry-level workers in AI-exposed fields like software development and customer service has seen steep declines.</p>

                <p><strong>Outlook:</strong> While nurses and blue-collar jobs in manufacturing or construction remain relatively safe from AI replacement, entry-level white-collar positions face inevitable restructuring over the next five years. Graduates must acquire advanced skills and expertise that AI cannot replicate to remain competitive in the labor market.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">3. Skills Gap Intensifies: 39% of Existing Skills Become Obsolete by 2030</h3>
                <p><strong>Current State:</strong> The gap between skills needed in the AI era and those possessed by college graduates is widening rapidly. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that by 2025, 50% of all employees will need reskilling due to new technology adoption, with over two-thirds of skills considered important today expected to change. Between 2025-2030, 39% of existing skill sets will become outdated, and McKinsey predicts that by 2030, 375 million workers globally—about 14% of the workforce—will need significant retraining to remain economically viable.</p>

AI-related skills, data analysis, and human-AI collaboration capabilities are becoming essential competencies, and without lifelong learning, the risk of being left behind in the labor market is significant.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">4. Job Polarization: Only High-Skilled vs Low-Skilled Jobs Remain</h3>
                <p><strong>Current State:</strong> AI automation is intensifying labor market polarization by concentrating on replacing middle-skill entry-level jobs. According to Microsoft research, 40 occupations including office work, education, computer engineering, design, and architecture are most exposed to AI—most of which are entry-level white-collar positions preferred by college graduates. Meanwhile, occupations requiring physical work like nursing, manufacturing, and construction, as well as high-skill positions requiring advanced expertise, remain relatively safe. This creates a "hollowing out of the middle" phenomenon.</p>

                <div class="trend-grid">
                    <div class="trend-card">
                        <h4>Safe Occupations</h4>
                        <p>• <strong>Nurses:</strong> Physical care work cannot be replaced by AI<br>
                        • <strong>Manufacturing/Construction Blue-Collar:</strong> Require hands-on work and on-site presence<br>
                        • <strong>Advanced Professionals:</strong> Doctors, lawyers, researchers requiring high expertise<br>
                        • <strong>Creative Leadership:</strong> Strategic planning, innovation management, and high-level decision-making<br>
                        • <strong>Human-Relationship Centered:</strong> Counseling, education, negotiation requiring interpersonal skills</p>

                </div>

                <p><strong>Outlook:</strong> As entry-level white-collar jobs that graduates traditionally entered disappear, new graduates face a choice: ①quickly acquire advanced expertise, ②transition to new roles collaborating with AI, or ③shift to occupations requiring physical work. With the first rung of the career ladder disappearing, pathways to the middle class are being blocked.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">5. Job Creation vs Elimination: Net Gain of 78 Million Jobs by 2030</h3>
                <p><strong>Current State:</strong> While AI destroys jobs, it also creates them, but the nature of eliminated jobs and created jobs differs completely. The World Economic Forum (WEF) projects that by 2030, 92 million jobs will be eliminated but 170 million new jobs will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs (7% of current employment). However, 77% of new AI-related jobs require master's degrees, and 350,000 new positions such as prompt engineers, human-AI collaboration specialists, and AI ethics officers require advanced technical expertise—creating barriers difficult for undergraduate graduates to overcome.</p>

                <p><strong>Outlook:</strong> While jobs will increase net by 2030, qualitative transformation is the core issue. Most new jobs replacing eliminated entry-level white-collar positions require high education and high skills, making it difficult for undergraduate graduates to enter the new job market without graduate school or intensive retraining. This risks deepening economic inequality among younger generations.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: #1a1a1a;">Response Guidelines</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <strong>Entry-Level White-Collar Aspirants → Immediate AI Collaboration Skills Development</strong><br>
                        Reason: 50% of existing entry-level work will be automated within 5 years. Ability to integrate AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Notion AI) into work has emerged as essential survival skill. Traditional degrees alone provide insufficient competitiveness.<br><br>
                        <strong>Undergraduate Graduates → Combine Micro-Credentials with Practical Certifications</strong><br>
                        Reason: 77% of new AI jobs require master's degrees. In a market where undergraduate graduation alone creates difficult entry, bootcamps, digital badges, and industry certifications (AWS, Google Cloud, HubSpot) must demonstrate immediately applicable skills.<br><br>
                        <strong>Career Transition Candidates → Reorient to AI-Resistant Occupations</strong><br>
                        Reason: Nursing, physical therapy, construction, manufacturing (physical work-required) or creativity/relationship-centered advanced professions (counseling, education, strategy) face low AI automation risk and provide stable career paths.<br><br>
                        <strong>Governments and Educational Institutions → Urgent Lifelong Learning Infrastructure</strong><br>
                        Reason: 375 million people need retraining. National-scale massive skills transition support, like Korea's 11,000 AI talent cultivation and US AI retraining programs, is key to mitigating youth unemployment.
                    </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 1rem; color: #4a4a4a;"><strong>Overall Market Assessment:</strong> Critical Warning - The graduate job market is at its worst in a decade, with 50% of entry-level jobs expected to disappear within 5 years due to AI automation. Traditional degrees alone cannot ensure competitiveness; AI skills development, micro-credentials, and career reorientation are survival strategies. Swift skills transition support from governments and educational institutions is essential.</p>
